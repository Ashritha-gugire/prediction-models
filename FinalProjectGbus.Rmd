## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
loan_data<- readRDS("C:\\Users\\ashri\\Documents\\GBUS 738\\Final project\\loandata.rds")
```


```{r}

str(loan_data)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
glimpse(loan_data)
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(loan_data))
```


```{r}
summary(loan_data)
```
From the above summary statistics we can understand that number of people who defaulted the loan are less when compared with those who didn't. That indicates most of them did there payments on time. 
If we observe the average loan amount borrowed was $16K and average monthly installment was 489 with interest rate of 11.38%, and most of them has purpose because of debt consolidation and they were individuals who took for a period of three years and many of them have an average of 73k annual income.

In here we cannot get a detailed statistics about anything. Therefore, lets try to understand the data deeply in ordered to find which factors are related for defaulting the loan and how many costly errors is the model expected to produce (customers classified as not defaulting, but eventually do)

##Data Analysis

We will first look at the distributions of and between some characteristics of the loan or the borrower of the loan. This will help us determine which predictor variables may have interesting patterns.


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = loan_data, mapping = aes(x = interest_rate)) +
geom_histogram(fill = "#006EA1", color = "white", bins = 15) +
labs(title = "Figure 1: Distribution of people defaulting their loans in relation to interest rates", x =
"interest rates", y = "number of people defaulting their loans")+facet_grid(loan_default ~ history_bankruptcy)
```

```{r}
loan_data %>% group_by(interest_rate) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = interest_rate, y = count, fill = count >= 40), width = 0.05) +
# fill colors
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("darksalmon", "lightskyblue3"), labels = c("count < 40", "count >= 40"),
                     guide = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)) +
# theme
    theme_classic() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9)) +
# labels
    labs(x = "Interest Rate (in %)", y = "Frequency",
         title = "Figure 2.Frequency of Individual Interest Rates", fill = "Count") + 
# scales
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, 100))
    
```
```{r}
loan_data %>% group_by(loan_amount) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = loan_amount, y = count, fill = count >= 40), width = 50) +
# fill colors
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("darksalmon", "lightskyblue3"), labels = c("count < 40", "count >= 40"),
                     guide = guide_legend(reverse=TRUE)) +
# theme
    theme_classic() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = c(0.9, 0.9)) +
# labels
    labs(x = "Loan Amount (in thousands)", y = "Frequency",
         title = "Figure 3. Frequency of Individual Loan Amounts", fill = "Count") + 
# scales
    scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0), labels = seq(0, 40, 10)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0), limits = c(0, 200))
```
From the above two graphs, it is interesting to note that the values of interest rate and loan amount have varied frequency, with some values occurring over 40 times in the dataset and others occurring only once. This is probably because some interest rates and amounts are more popular as parts of standard loan pacakges.

```{r}
#str(loan_data)
loan_data %>% group_by(loan_purpose) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% ggplot() +
    geom_col(aes(x = reorder(loan_purpose, count), y = count, fill = count<30)) +
# fill colors
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("lightsteelblue", "darksalmon"),
                     labels = c( "count < 30")) +
# theme
    theme_classic() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, angle = 20, hjust = 0.7),
                            plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                           legend.position = "bottom") +
# labels
    labs(x = "purpose", y = "Frequency", fill = "Count",
         title = "Distribution of Reasons for Taking Out Loan")




ggplot(data = loan_data, aes(x = term)) +
    geom_bar(position= "dodge",fill= "lightblue") +
# theme
    theme_classic() + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
# labels
    labs(x = "Term of Loan (in Years)", y = "Frequency",
         title = "Figure 4: Distribution of Loan Terms")

```

In the above first figure it is clear that debt are the most common reasons that borrowers take out loans.This is probably because people take out loans to pay off pre-existing debts or to pay off  bills, and there is no high variability between the categories provided.

In the above second figure we get to know that there are far more short-term loans than lon- term loans.
